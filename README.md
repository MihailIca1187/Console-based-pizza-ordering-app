# Console-based-pizza-ordering-app
This is a console based, proof of concept that I have built as part of my university course.

It is a relatively simple, albeit not that well organised solution for my first assignment of the programming module, part of the Computer
Science course I am currently undertaking.

It has been an opportunity to learn about functions, practical use of dynamic exit and controlling program flow through the use of loops 
used to create menus and sub-menus.

The main challenge faced while working on this program was finding the correct implementation of the loops in order to have the correct
behaviour required by the menu functionality.
